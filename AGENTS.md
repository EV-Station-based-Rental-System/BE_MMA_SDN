# Agents.

Agents are automated teammates that assist in development, documentation, and operations for this project. They follow project-wide standards, enforce consistency, and help implement features safely by adhering to shared patterns for architecture, data access, validation, testing, and security across the codebase.

## Core Principles and Constitution.

The detailed architecture, operational rules, and core principles for all agents are defined in our central constitution document. This serves as the single source of truth.
