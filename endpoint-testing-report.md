## Issues Found

### 1. Field Name Inconsistencies
- **RenterDto**: Contains duplicate `@ApiProperty` decorator in the DTO
- **UpdateUserDto**: Requires `phone` field even when it's marked as optional in the schema
- **Booking Creation**: Uses different field names than expected (`rental_start_datetime` vs `start_time`)

### 2. Business Logic Issues  
- **Booking Creation**: Complex validation logic requiring approved KYC, exact amount calculations, and vehicle availability checks
- **Amount Validation**: "Total amount mismatch" error without clear guidance on expected calculation
- **Vehicle Availability**: No clear endpoint to check vehicle availability before booking

### 3. Server Errors
- **Booking Confirmation**: Returns 500 error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toString')"  
- **Payment Confirmation**: Same 500 error pattern, suggesting a common undefined variable issue

### 4. API Path Inconsistencies
- Base URL is `https://hostname/` not `https://hostname/api/` as initially expected
- Some endpoints work at root level, others might expect `/api` prefix

### 5. Complex Nested Structures
- **Vehicle with Station and Pricing**: Requires deeply nested object structure that may not be well documented in Swagger

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix Server Errors
- Debug the booking confirmation and payment confirmation endpoints
- Add proper null/undefined checks for the toString() operations

### 2. Improve Documentation
- Update Swagger documentation to reflect actual field names used
- Add examples for complex nested request structures
- Document exact amount calculation logic for bookings

### 3. Enhance Validation
- Make optional fields truly optional in DTOs
- Provide clearer error messages for validation failures
- Add endpoint to check vehicle availability and pricing calculation

### 4. Standardize Field Names
- Decide on consistent naming convention (snake_case vs camelCase)
- Update either the DTOs or the Swagger documentation to match

### 5. Add Helper Endpoints
- Create an endpoint to calculate booking totals before creation
- Add vehicle availability checking endpoint
- Provide KYC status checking for users
