## Notes

- Clarifications resolved per product decisions:
  - Deletion policy: prefer soft-delete; otherwise block hard-delete if referenced.
  - Role matrix: Admin full CRUD; Staff CRUD on operational (Booking, Rental, Payment), read-only on catalog; Renter read own and limited updates.
  - Phase scope: Phase 1 covers User, Vehicle, Station, Booking, Rental, Payment; remaining entities in follow-ups.
